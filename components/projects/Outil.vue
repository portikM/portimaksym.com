        One day I was chatting with my friend and she told me how she had to
        redo the voiceover for her presentation 5 times over. I thought it would
        be cool to have an online recording tool that would allow users to undo
        last few seconds of recording and resume from there. That's what I tried
        to achieve with Outil.<br /><br />All heavy lifting is done on the
        server side, which allows for great flexability on the client side.
